# Docker 

Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. A container is a sandboxed process running on a host machine that is isolated from all other processes running on that host machine. These containers can run consistently on any system, streamlining software development, deployment, and scaling processes, while ensuring isolation and reproducibility.

This Repository contains all of my Notes and Projects i made learning Docker.
